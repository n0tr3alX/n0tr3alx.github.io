<p>Since 2024, the &lsquo;Fake Captcha&rsquo; technique has become very common. It is a social engineering attack that tricks the user into executing a command locally on their endpoint, after which the next stages of the malware are downloaded and executed.</p>
<p>A lot of threat actors are using this technique to spread Lumma Stealer, which has been one of the <a href="https://any.run/malware-trends/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">most commonly used stealers</a>!</p>
<p>In this post, I am going to explore some of its stages and the deobfuscation of the payloads, focusing on JavaScript, PowerShell, and .NET.</p>]]></description>

<p><a href="https://www.cobaltstrike.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Cobalt Strike</a> is a commercial red team and adversary simulation tool. It is widely used by security professionals to assess the security of networks and systems by simulating advanced persistent threats (APTs). As everything, due to its powerful capabilities, it has also been misused by cybercriminals and threat actors.</p>
<p>In this post contains the analysis of two samples: Staged and Stageless payload. The extraction of the shellcode and the beacon for its configuration are quite similar in both payloads.</p>]]></description>
