<p>ATM malwares are designed to compromise and manipulate automated teller machines (ATMs) for financial gain. These threats require the attacker to have physical access to the ATM to install the malware (Like a USB port access), connect external devices for activation, and, of course, cash out the money without requiring a card.</p>
<p>There are many ATM malwares families but for this post i&rsquo;m focusing in the Ploutus malware family. Ploutus was first identified in Mexico in 2013 and has since evolved with new variants, including Ploutus-D, which emerged in 2017. This malware was first seen targeting <a href="https://www.kal.com/en/products/kalignite-platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">KAL’s Kalignite application</a>, which runs on various ATM vendors across different countries. However, the list of ATM vendors targeted has been observed to increase with new variants of the malware.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>Since 2024, the &lsquo;Fake Captcha&rsquo; technique has become very common. It is a social engineering attack that tricks the user into executing a command locally on their endpoint, after which the next stages of the malware are downloaded and executed.</p>
<p>A lot of threat actors are using this technique to spread Lumma Stealer, which has been one of the <a href="https://any.run/malware-trends/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">most commonly used stealers</a>!</p>
<p>In this post, I am going to explore some of its stages and the deobfuscation of the payloads, focusing on JavaScript, PowerShell, and .NET.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.cobaltstrike.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">Cobalt Strike</a> is a commercial red team and adversary simulation tool. It is widely used by security professionals to assess the security of networks and systems by simulating advanced persistent threats (APTs). As everything, due to its powerful capabilities, it has also been misused by cybercriminals and threat actors.</p>
<p>In this post contains the analysis of two samples: Staged and Stageless payload. The extraction of the shellcode and the beacon for its configuration are quite similar in both payloads.</p>]]></description>
